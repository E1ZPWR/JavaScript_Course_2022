    <h3>Short Bio</h3>
    <div>
        <h3>Kiraly</h3>
        <p>
            Originally gaining her Nursing degree here in Australia in 1995, and with
            a few years of practical experience under her belt, Kiraly moved to the
            UK, where she undertook various nursing posts, and met her Aussie husband.
            On return to Australia, and after the welcome arrival of their child
            through IVF, in 2012, the family moved to Perth, WA, her husband’s
            hometown. In 2018, and back in Melbourne, she saw an ad for Parentmedic.
            Kiraly was working as a part-time School Nurse at the time, and it was her
            experience of motherhood, including the ‘fear and dread’ she understood,
            that drew her to the brand. Even as a nurse she was acutely aware that
            ‘motherhood doesn’t come with a manual.’ Her extensive experience here and
            overseas, as a professional nurse and a loving mother drives her passion
            for Parentmedic

        <h3>Prue</h3>
        <p>
            Prue’s gravitation to nursing was almost organic. At school, she had the
            idea she’d like to work with kids and undertook her year 10 work
            experience in a childrens’ oncology ward. Primarily involved with music
            and play therapy, her few glimpses into medical procedures did nothing to
            put her off. Born and bred in Geelong, Prue lives with her husband and two
            kids – aged 3 and 5 – and she’s now been an emergency department
            Registered Nurse for 12 years. Her acute knowledge of the strain on
            emergency departments, coupled with limited access to out of hours GPs or
            clinics in Geelong and surrounding towns, means she understands the
            immense benefits that the Parentmedic movement offers. She’s been a
            Parentmedic educator since 2018. Prue is passionate – and pragmatic – that
            Parentmedic training equips parents and carers of babies and young
            children with the confidence and skills to deal with an injury or ailment,
            whilst waiting for assistance, or even instead of a visit to the emergency
            department. Read More

    <h3>Long Story</h3>
    <div id = "kdiv" style = "font-weight: 400;">
        <h3>Kiraly's Story</h3>
        <p>
            Kiraly was always going to be a nurse – according to her parents, her
            career aspirations were cemented from the age of four. A born-and-bred
            Melburnian, after school Kiraly went on to study nursing and gained her
            degree in 1995 through Australian Catholic University. Then, as many young
            Aussies did in the 80s and 90s, she took her credentials to the UK to work
            and gain some life experience. Over 11 years she undertook various nursing
            posts, including working with the BBC as a Travel Health nurse. She also
            met her Aussie husband. On their return to Australia in 2009, and back in
            Melbourne, Kiraly and her husband went through the IVF process – several
            times – before they successfully welcomed a baby girl to the family in
            2011. After the birth, with their precious bundle of joy just a few months
            old, the family moved across the country to her husband’s hometown of
            Perth. Kiraly continued as a working mum in the City of Light before the
            family returned to Melbourne in 2017. Back in Melbourne, Kiraly opted for
            some more life balance, and secured a position as a school nurse on a
            part-time basis, enabling her more time for the family. It also enabled
            her to respond to the ad for Parentmedic in 2018. Her professional
            experience as a nurse, combined with the ‘fear and dread’ of becoming a
            mum to her ‘miracle baby’, meant she was able to recognise the
            possibilities and benefits that Parentmedic could afford young mums and
            carers. Kiraly freely admits that despite her Nursing experience and
            medical knowledge, panic and fear can still override confidence, when
            dealing with a medical emergency, especially when it’s personal. This is
            behind her passion for Parentmedic education and the Parentmedic movement.
            Empowering parents and carers with confidence to deal with minor ailments
            or accidents while awaiting emergency care. The calm and confidence the
            education offers her attendees, and the light bulb moments they experience
            are what drive her. Partnering with Prue through their Parentmedic
            Victoria Business Pod (Franchise), both ladies aspire to “Helping ONE
            MILLION people access Parentmedic Community Health Programs by 2030.”
            Still working as a part-time school nurse, she and her Parentmedic
            business partner, Prue, are frequent flyers at expos and community events
            spreading the word of the Parentmedic movement. They are actively involved
            with and regularly attend the Parents, Baby and Child Expo, and have held
            events and sessions in collaboration with The Salvation Army in Ballarat,
            Catholic Care and Family Life.

        <h3>Prue's Story</h3>
        <p>
            Prue is a Geelong native and threw herself headfirst into nursing
            organically. The idea of working with kids was always there, and her year
            10 work experience position in a kids’ oncology ward cemented her desire
            to become a nurse. Prue’s practical placements while finishing her degree,
            and in her graduating year took her from Swan Hill on the NSW border, to
            Werribee Mercy on the western outskirts of Melbourne, before she finally
            settled into a role with the emergency department back in Geelong.
            Emergency medicine became her career. Prue completed her postgraduate
            diploma in Critical Care – Emergency Nursing. Through her career
            transition, and two kids now aged 3 and 5, she’s still working with kids
            and adults in emergency medical care. She’s been a Parentmedic educator
            since 2018. Her inspiration for becoming a Parentmedic educator and
            franchisee operator is derived from the almost daily occurrence of ED
            attendance by parents with children and babies, seeking reassurance
            because they are unsure of what symptoms may indicate, and/or they have
            been seeking advice from Dr Google, that effectively exacerbated their
            alarm. She’s aware that Parentmedic education can circumvent Geelong’s
            overstretched emergency departments and the lack of out of hours GPs and
            clinics. She is empathetic to the lack of fundamental first aid knowledge
            for many young mums and carers. Pragmatically though, she hopes that by
            offering increased knowledge in the fundamentals of baby and child first
            aid, educators can give parents the confidence to know when and where to
            seek medical advice, in turn assisting in alleviating some of the
            stressors on an already overstretched healthcare system. Babies and
            children are going to get unwell at some stage in their early years, and
            fevers, rashes and diarrhoea are all very common symptoms of childhood
            illnesses. As an educator, Prue hopes that the skills and fundamentals
            that Parentmedic offer, enables parents and carers to realise that for
            most children these indicators can be completely harmless, and they can be
            managed safely at home. knows that when you explain to parents the things
            they can do for common afflictions at home, their confidence, and the
            simple treatments they can apply, can prevent unnecessarily anxiety and
            fear, and in many cases that even more stressful trip to emergency. The
            busy mum of 2, when she has time, likes bush-walking, gets a bit crafty
            and loves baking. She admits she loves being busy, and the role of
            Parentmedic educator and franchisee operator aligned with her values and
            interests. Sharing her knowledge, and offering her experience to impart
            confidence and calm is her passion.
