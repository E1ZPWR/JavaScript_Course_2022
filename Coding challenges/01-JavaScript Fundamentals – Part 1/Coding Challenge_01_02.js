//! Coding Challenge #1

// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
// calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
// and height in meter).

// Your tasks:
// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
// versions)
// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

// Test data:
// § Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95m tall.
// § Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76m tall.

// ! Coding Challenge #2

// Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and
// improve it.
// Your tasks:
// 1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
// is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
// 2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
// BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
// Hint: Use an if/else statement 😉

//? Answer (Based on Data 1)
//declearation the variable for Marks and Johns
let markHigh = 1.69;
let markWeight = 78;

let johnHigh = 1.95;
let johnWeight = 92;

//Claculation of Marks and Johns BMI
markBMI = markWeight / markHigh ** 2;
johnBMI = johnWeight / johnHigh ** 2;

//console log the result
console.log(`Marks's BMI is ${markBMI}, and John's BMI is ${johnBMI}`);
//Compare the BMI b/w two
let markHigherBMI = markBMI > johnBMI;
if (markHigherBMI) {
    console.log(`Mark's BMI (${markBMI}) is higher than John's (${johnBMI})`);
} else {
    console.log(`John's BMI (${johnBMI}) is higher than Mark's (${markBMI})`);
}
